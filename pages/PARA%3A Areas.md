## About
	- According to the [[Book/Building a Second Brain]] methodology by [[Tiago Forte]], Areas are *buckets of ongoing activity with expected quality standards.*
	- Organize these based on what is relevant to your ongoing work. Once these particular areas are no longer relevant to you, change the status to Archive. Examples of areas are:
		- Relationships with your manager, peers, partners, friends
		- Your professional development and an engineer or architect
		- Topical Guilds you participate in
		- 1:1 meetings
		- etc.
	- Within a Area bucket, capture anything that seems interesting or relevant e.g.
		- Regular/ongoing meetings with notes
		- Action Items
		- etc.

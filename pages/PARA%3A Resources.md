## About
	- According to the [[Book/Building a Second Brain]] methodology by [[Tiago Forte]], Resources are *buckets of useful or otherwise interesting things.*
	- Organize these by topics you are currently interested in or are related to topics that are relevant to your current work. Once these particular resources are no longer relevant to you, change the status to Archive.
		- Frameworks or Languages you work with
		- Topics you are researching or are relevant to your work
		- etc.
	- Within a resource bucket, capture anything that seems interesting e.g.
		- Useful Code Snippets
		- Links to Useful Websites
		- Things you've learned about relevant technologies

							- Projects - what i'm working on right now
								- The benefits of organizing by project (vs artificial indexing systems)
									- Projects have a beginning and end
									- They have a clear outcome
									- It creates cross-polination
								- Examples of projects
									- Projects at work
									- Personal projects
									- Side Projects
								- > If you are not already framing your work in terms of specific, concrete projects, making this shif will give you a powerful jump start to your productivity
								- connect this to how the best self journal is organized
							- Areas - What I'm committed to over time
								- Not everything is a project, some things are ongoing
								- Examples of Areas
									- Activities or places you are responsible for:
									- People you are responsible for or accountable to
										- An example is my team template or 1:1 template
									- Standards of your performance you are responsible for
									- In your job or business
										- Departments or functions you are responsible for
										- People or teams you are responsible for or accountable to
										- Standards of performance you are responsible for
									- >Even though areas have no final outcome, it is still important to manage them.
									- >While there is no go to reach, there is a *standard* you want to uphold in each area.... Only you can decide what those standards are. For our puproses, it helps tremendiously to have a place dedicated to each of them. That way you always have somewhere to put any thought, reflection, idea, or useful tidbit of information relevant to each important aspect of your life
										- TODO maybe a tech radar example?
							- Resources - Things I want to reference in the future
								- Examples
									- What topics are you interested in?
									- What subjects are you researching?
									- What useful information do you want to be able to reference?
									- Which hobbies or passions do you have?
								- Any of the examples could become it's own resource folder. You can also think of them as "research" or "reference materials"
							- Archives - Thinks I've completed or put on hold
								- Cold storage
									- I generally keep these things in logseq but I may export certain graphs into other folders
								- Examples
									- Projects that are completed or cancelled
									- areas of responsibility that you are no longer committed to
									- Resources that are no longer relevant

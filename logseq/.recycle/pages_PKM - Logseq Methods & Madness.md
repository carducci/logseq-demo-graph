	  abstract:: "We are knowledge workers and ultimately, we must own our growth and learning. [Personal Knowledge Management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_knowledge_management) is a process of collecting information that one uses to gather, classify, store, search, retrieve and share knowledge in their daily activities and the way in which these processes support work activities. Despite taking notes, bookmarking web content, and highlighting passages in books; often we struggle to recall or rediscover these many insights we pick up daily in our work and life. This session introduces a tool and some process recommendations to never again lose discoveries and knowledge resources. Logseq is a privacy-first, open-source knowledge base that works on top of local plain-text Markdown and Org-mode files. Use it to write, organize and share your thoughts, keep your to-do list, and build your own digital garden. It naturally connects what you know the same way your brain does, and makes it easier to make everything you learn actionable and always at your fingertips. Logseq has become an indispensable tool both for Michael and for many other speakers at No Fluff. You'll learn the basics, tips and tricks, recommendations, and leave armed to deploy this tool right away as you continue learning at the conference!"

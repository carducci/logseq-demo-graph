- ## Objective
	- id:: 66475e66-8acb-498d-87d4-714055ddf5a2
	  > Join us for a transformative hands-on workshop on Personal Knowledge Management (PKM), designed specifically to empower developers, architects, and knowledge workers alike to master information in this information age. Based on Tiago Forte's Building a Second Brain methodology and implemented using the Logseq PKM application, this course aims to equip attendees with the strategies, tools, and insights to streamline their knowledge management, increase productivity, and stimulate creativity. Attendees will learn to construct a personal knowledge graph, effectively annotate and reference digital assets, manage tasks, journal for success, leverage templates, and much more. The ultimate goal is to create a personalized system that enables you to instantly find or recall everything you know and learn.
